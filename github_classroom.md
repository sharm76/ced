<br>GitHub Classroom is one of the many tools available online that allow instructors to manage and organize their classes. According to [GitHub Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_GitHub), this product line was released in 2015 after which many features have been added or updated. It is primarily be used for sending out assignments to the students, provide them with the starter code and continuous feedback. It requires the users, which can either be instructors, students, or TAs, to have prior knowledge of how GitHub works and what is it used for.

<br>To use the GitHub Classroom, instructors need to work with GitHub and GitHub Classroom in parallel. Instructors and students need to first sign up on GitHub. Instructors can then use the same account for GitHub Classroom to manage their classes. First, an organization is created in GitHub which is an umbrella under which various classrooms can be created along with some high-level settings. After creating the organization, instructors can then Sign in to the GitHub Classroom and create one or more classrooms under the same organization. While creating a classroom, they also have an option to invite TA's and admins to the organization. After the invitation, they also need to send a URL (of the classroom) to join the classroom, which seems to be a redundant task. One of the interesting features provided by GitHub Classroom is the integration with third-party Learning Management Systems such as Google Classroom, Canvas, Sakai, etc. This integration allows the automatic import of the roster to the class. Alternatively, they can also add the student roster manually or by uploading CSV/text files.

<br>After creating the classroom, assignments can be created for that particular classroom. An assignment can be configured by setting the title of the assignment, its deadline (i.e. date & time), and selecting whether it is an individual assignment or group assignment. Instructors can also link a repository that contains boilerplate code with the assignment which will be used by students while solving the assignment. There is another interesting feature available that allows instructors to integrate one of the two online IDEs i.e. Microsoft MakeCode or Repl.it with an assignment. The URL of the assignment is then shared with the students.

<br>Autograding feature of the GitHub Classroom can be used to set test cases by adding inputs and corresponding outputs along with the setup and run command while creating the assignment. To ensure that no test case run infinitely, the timeout option is used. Points earned for each passed test case can be added while creating the test case.

<br>For every student (or group if it is a group assignment) that accepts this assignment, a repository will be created under the student's account. The repository can be public or private as selected by the instructor while creating the assignment. Students can then download the starter code, if made available by the instructor, in their repository and start making changes to the code. If an online IDE has been linked with the assignment, students can open that IDE from README.md and work on it. Once the assignment is done, students can commit changes to the repository which will make the changes visible to the instructor. The instructor can then provide feedback and grades (if autograding feature is not used) to the students.

GitHub Classroom is most suitable for CS students who have prior knowledge of GitHub and know its purpose. Codesharing becomes easier with this tool and people who enjoy coding will love it. It allows continuous feedback from instructors. Instructors can easily assess the contribution of each individual in a group project and also see graphical insights of their performance in GitHub. Procrastinators need to be careful because instructors can see the time and progress of their assignments anytime. Working with two product lines at the same time can be confusing for the instructors in the beginning but once they get used to it, it might be an interesting tool. For students, it can provide an exposure to one of the most popular Version Control System used by industries.
